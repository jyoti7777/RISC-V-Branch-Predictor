Files:
1. branch_predictor_204.cpp
   - Description: C++ program for analyzing four branch predictors: always taken, always not-taken, one-bit, and two-bit.
   - Functionality: Analyzes a trace provided through a text document (default name: "input.txt") with a limit of one million lines.
   - Outputs: Prints Branch Target Buffer (PC of the branch instruction, target address PC, and history) and overall accuracy of the four predictors.
   - Note: Line 51 of the code should specify the name of the trace document.
   
2. Branch_Prediction_Analysis_Report.pdf
   - Description: Documentation/report detailing the analysis of branch predictors.
   - Content: Likely includes analysis methodology, results, and conclusions drawn from the experiment.

3. Test Cases:

   - Description: Test case for recursion analysis.
   
   b. Bubble_test_Lab
   - Description: Test case for bubble sort analysis.
   
   c. sqrt_test_Lab
   - Description: Test case for square root computation analysis.
